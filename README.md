👨‍💻 Hey, I’m Akhil

I’m a coder who loves building things — whether it’s a web app that actually solves a problem or a Java project that pushes me to learn something new. For me, coding isn’t just about writing functions; it’s about creating, experimenting, breaking stuff, and fixing it again until it works better.

🚀 What I Do

🌐 Web Development → Playing around with React, Node.js, and modern frontend magic

☕ Java Projects → Building backends with Java + Spring Boot, APIs, and automation tools

⚡ Experimenting → Side projects, learning by doing, and trying new frameworks/tech

📂 Sharing → My GitHub is a collection of experiments, ideas, and projects I actually enjoyed making

💡 My Vibe

I like to keep things simple but powerful. Most of my projects start with curiosity, turn into late-night coding sessions and end up teaching me something new. I’m always down to collaborate, learn and make something cool.
